# Hello.

<summary>
    My name is Kristian. I am an independent developer making
    software in Copenhagen, Denmark.
</summary>

I work with business critical applications in administration, finance, statistics and science. Occasionally I also function as a technical project manager or teacher.

I am a fan of open source, but I don’t get to spend a lot of time working on my own projects.

If you want to find my professional profile, my company is called [Bitkompagniet ApS](http://bitkompagniet.dk/) - or you can take a look at my [profile on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kparkov/) or my [resumé (CV)](https://github.com/kparkov/kvp).

I also intend to use this site for collecting interesting links. The best of which will end up in my [personal awesome list](https://github.com/kparkov/kparkovs-awesome).
